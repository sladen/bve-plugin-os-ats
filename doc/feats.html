<h1>OS_ATS plug-in features</h1>

<p>
The most significant features of the plug-in are listed here with
a brief explanation. For more detailed information, see the list
of attributes on the "how to configure" page. It's still worth the
time to browse through the text to see what can be done with the
plug-in. Taking a look and even copying text from the demo trains'
<code>Panel2.cfg</code> and <code>OS_Ats1.cfg</code> files won't
do any harm either if you have trouble customizing your own train
to use features offered by the plug-in.
</p>


<h2>Safety systems</h2>

<h3>AWS</h3>
<p>
British AWS is a system which alarms the driver audibly and visually
when the train is approaching a signal showing danger or caution, or
a fixed speed limit. If the driver doesn't acknowledge the alarm, the
train is braked to a stand.
</p>

<h3>TPWS</h3>
<p>
British TPWS is a supplementary device used in conjunction with the
AWS to enhance train safety. TPWS brakes the train to a stand without
advance warning if it approaches a signal at danger, or a fixed speed
limit too fast. The train is halted also upon SPADing. An override
feature is included for passing a signal at danger under permission.
</p>

<h3>Trainstop</h3>
<p>
Trainstop is a simpler version of TPWS, which only stops the train
when it SPADs. This is intended for LU or similar use.
</p>

<h3>Vigilance</h3>
<p>
Vigilance / EB / dead man's brake is a device which regularly
tests the driver's state. If the driver is for some reason unable
to acknowledge the device in a short period of time, the train
will come to a halt.
</p>

<h3>Overspeed</h3>
<p>
Overspeed safety device monitors a fixed maximum allowed speed of the
train, and warns the driver if it's exceeded. The train may be braked
automatically to a safe speed upon speeding.
</p>


<h2>Traction specific</h2>

<h3>Generic</h3>
<p>
Motor and engine temperatures are possible to simulate with the plug-in.
Temperature can raise depending on the use of power, with the part of
train eventually overheating and breaking down, unless power is eased.
A simple mock ammeter is available for electric trains.
</p>

<h3>Diesel</h3>
<p>
For Diesel trains it is possible to simulate fuel usage with fueling points
possibly somewhere along the route, and engine stopping upon running out of
fuel. Also a mechanical gearbox is featured with automatic or manual gear
shifting. For mechanical transmission, the engine RPM is modeled with a
visual panel tachometer. It's also possible to define the performance of
the engine on each gear.
</p>

<h3>Steam</h3>
<p>
Steam locomotives are modeled simply in the plug-in. In addition to reverser
and regulator, the driver has to adjust the cutoff to get the locomotive move
efficiently and quickly, at the same time trying to conserve steam to keep
sufficient boiler pressure. Injector has to be regularly used to move water
from the tanks or tender to the boiler. Water in the boiler turns slowly into
steam and pressure, but the injector feeding water also requires steam to operate.
</p>


<h2>Others</h2>

<h3>Power</h3>
<p>
Pantograph / pickup shoe positions on an electric train can be defined, and the
train will behave correctly when running on an overhead wire isolating section,
or on a section where power rail is missing. Three different behaviour patterns
are provided for such sections.
</p>

<h3>Windshield</h3>
<p>
OS_ATS plug-in enables the train developer to create a windshield with animated wiper.
Also raindrops splashing and sticking on the windshield until being wiped are possible.
Sounds can be associated to both features.
</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>
Various minor safety measures such as traction interlocks and different forced brakings
are included, along with extended features relating to reverser. It's possible to add
a digital display in the cab indicating the location of the train. The location data
could be added to the timetable for indicating e.g. the station stop and signal locations.
