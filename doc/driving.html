<h1>Driving the OS_ATS plug-in demo trains</h1>
<p>
The plug-in package comes with three demo trains: a "modern" EMU,
an old DMU with 4-speed mechanical transmission, and a steam
locomotive. Each of these has a simple imitation of the controls
and characteristics of the traction type. Getting the demo trains
moving can be hard without instructions.
</p>


<h4>Preparing to start (common for all three)</h4>
<ol>
<li>Move reverser forwards</li>
<li>Acknowledge all safety devices if triggered by the reverser</li>
<li>Release brakes fully</li>
<li>Wait for doors to close</li>
<li>Check that brakes are released</li>
</ol>

<h4>Electric</h4>
<ol>
<li>Check that you didn't set the reminder device on by accident</li>
<li>Set throttle to neutral</li>
<li>Apply throttle, and train should start moving</li>
</ol>
<p>
When moving, monitor motor temperature, and decrease throttle if overheat lamp lits.
</p>

<h4>Diesel</h4>
<ol>
<li>Change to gear 1, or set automatic gearbox on</li>
<li>Apply throttle</li>
</ol>
<p>
Monitor engine temperature when moving, and shift gears if RPM is too high or too low.
Note that you can only shift gears when throttle is at neutral, and that you can also
shift gears when the automatic gearbox is on, unless the auto gearbox insists on
setting a particular gear.
</p>

<h4>Steam</h4>
<ol>
<li>Set cutoff to 75% forwards, or set automatic cutoff on</li>
<li>Apply throttle</li>
</ol>
<p>
You must begin to slowly decrease the cutoff as the speed increases, to maintain
acceleration. If boiler water level seems to be getting too low, set injector on.
If there's a fair amount of water in the boiler, and boiler pressure is getting
low, make sure injector is off. You can't operate cutoff and injector if
automatic cutoff is on.
</p>

<h4>When moving</h4>
<p>
Depending on the safety system installed in the train, you may need to acknowledge
alarms triggered by signals, or cancel the vigilance device if you don't touch the
controls for a certain period. When driving in rain, the windshield starts to
gather drops of water. Use the windshield wiper to do away with them.
</p>
<p>
Exact behaviour of AWS and TPWS safety systems and steam locomotives is not explained
here, and more information can be found over the Internet for example. However, short
descriptions are given in the features section of this instructions manual.

<h3>Special keys</h3>

<div style="float: right; width: 45%;">
<p>
The table on right shows the keys for the demo trains. For other trains the keys
may be different. In fact, BVE allows you to customize your keys. The default
column shows the BVE default key assignments, which'll probably work if you
haven't done any changes. If you have, you should be able to deduct the correct
key by the middle column information.
