<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>
BVE version 4 beta (and possibly newer versions in the future as well) support custom-made
"plug-ins" for trains. Technically the plug-in is a dynamically linked library, i.e. a
pre-compiled bunch of code. This one is written in C/C++. The purpose of the plug-in is
to make possible the modeling of all sorts of different train safety systems, but it can
be used for many other things as well.
</p>
<p>
This plug-in features some generic and some British safety systems, as well as different
many non-safety related features such as detailed traction modeling, e.g. steam locomotive
controls and manual gearboxes. The plug-in features are highly customizable, with over
100 attributes to fiddle with, so it can be used for non-British trains as well.
</p>
<p>
This distribution package is mainly aimed at train and route developers, with instructions
on how to use and setup the plug-in for the trains and routes. A test route with three different
demo trains is included, and whether you're a developer or not, you might be interested in
trying them. If you don't see how this plug-in package and its contents would be of any use
to you, feel free to remove it. Eventually if BVE trains using this plug-in appear, the plug-in
is included and pre-configured, so you don't even need to think about it. Still it could be
useful to try the demo trains to know what to expect from the BVE trains using the plug-in,
and how to actually drive them.

<h3>Known bugs</h3>
<p>
The plug-in hasn't been very thoroughly tested, so there probably exists some bugs.
If you happen to encounter one, please inform the author. See the e-mail address at
the bottom of this page. Some currently known issues include: power gaps and rain
will not work correctly when reversing, and automatic gearbox may not be 'sensible'
all the time. In addition the door state indicators may not work properly when jumping
stations.
