<h1>Making routes compatible with OS_ATS</h1>
<p>
Trains fitted with the plug-in do not require anything special from
the route to work correctly, but some features such as safety systems,
windshield water drops, power gaps and fueling points will not work.
</p>

<p>
To make a route compatible with OS_ATS is not a big deal. Simply insert
some <code>.Beacon</code> commands in correct places with certain parameters
(explained below), and any train equipped with the plug-in will have all
of its features enabled and working correctly. See BVE v4 csv-route commands
for more info on the <code>.Beacon</code> and advanced signalling commands.
</p>

<p>
In BVE v4, the new <code>.Beacon</code> command is used instead of the old
.Transponder command, being flexibler and better suited for the plug-ins.
The table below lists the beacons recognized by the OS_ATS plug-in, and
what effect they may have. The <code>.Beacon</code> command has four
parameters: The first integer is the type of the beacon, which distinguishes
it from other beacons. The second integer is the index to the visual object
placed at the location of the beacon. For the generic beacons you might want
to create an invisible object. The third integer links the beacon to a specific
signal. And finally the fourth integer is an supplementary parameter passed
to the plug-in. In case of speed parameter, kilometres per hour is used.

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="beaconlist">
<tr> <th style="width: 25%;">Command</th>              <th>Description</th></tr>
<tr> <th colspan="2">Generic</th></tr>
<tr> <td>.Beacon 20; x; 0; Length,</td>  <td>Start of nonelectrified gap in the overhead wire or power rail. Length is in metres.</td></tr>
<tr> <td>.Beacon 21; x; 0; Intensity,</td>  <td>Sets the rain intensity from this point onwards. Intensity maximum is 100, and minimum 0 (no rain). Currently this only affects how quickly drops appear on the windshield.</td></tr>
<tr> <td>.Beacon 22; x; 0; Border,</td>  <td>Starts or ends a fueling point section. If border is 1, the fueling section starts here. If border is 0, fueling section stops here.</td></tr>
<tr> <td>.Beacon 23; x; 0; Side,</td>  <td>Defines the door operation at next station stop. If side is 0, doors remain closed. Side -1 means left door opens, 1 means right door. 2 for both doors. It's recommended to insert two beacons per station: one ahead of the stopping position range, and one at the exact stop position.</td></tr>
<tr> <th colspan="2">UK-related (safety systems)</th></tr>
<tr> <td>.Beacon 44000; x; 1; 0,</td>  <td>AWS signal approach magnet. AWS alarm goes off if the next signal is not showing 'clear' aspect at the time of train running over the magnet.</td></tr>
<tr> <td>.Beacon 44001; x; 0; 0,</td>  <td>Fixed AWS warning magnet. AWS alarm goes off when train runs over the magnet.</td></tr>
<tr> <td>.Beacon 44002; x; 1; Speed,</td>  <td>TPWS signal approach magnet. TPWS stops train if the next signal is at danger, and train's speed exceeds the defined value.</td></tr>
<tr> <td>.Beacon 44003; x; 0; 0,</td>  <td>TPWS/LU Trainstop. Train is stopped if the adjacent signal is at danger at the time of train running over the magnet.</td></tr>
<tr> <td>.Beacon 44004; x; 0; Speed,</td>  <td>TPWS fixed speed limit approach magnet. TPWS stops train if speed exceeds the defined value.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The signal approach magnets should be placed well ahead of the actual signal.
However, the trainstop magnet command should be placed immediately after the
signal <code>.SigF</code> and <code>.Section</code> commands. From the aspect
indices inserted in the <code>.Section</code> command, 0 is interpreted as
a danger aspect, and indices with value greater or equal to 4 are concidered
clear aspects. Indices 1 - 3 are various caution aspects.
